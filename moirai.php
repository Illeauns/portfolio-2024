        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1400">Moirai is a conceptual retail store with Japandi influences. I
            built Moirai for businesses that need an
            e-commerce website and to make a product that is carefully curated, intentional and detail-oriented.

                beautiful imagery that gives customers a
                sense of texture and colorways. The way that the carousels and grids are laid out are meant to convey
                space and ease, and a large navigation is inviting to the user.</p>

        <h3>Learning Challenges</h3>
        <p>Design-wise, building this website required thoughtful curation of products and styles of the
            navigation and layout to maintain a cohesive theme. I ran into challenges implementing JavaScript on
            multiple
            features like the carousel which I had to use creative workarounds and asking coding communities to solve.

        <h3>Learning Challenges - continued</h3>
        <p>
            Each page is fully fleshed out, so implementing iterable code was essential to maintain the page. On top of
            that,
            crossover between sections required me to test my debugging skills to ensure every page is working. Finally,
            the
            website has multiple different sections with differing layouts that required me to choose and make
            distinctions
            between Flexbox and Grid.

        <h3>Room for improvement</h3>
        <p>There are aspects that need improvement, however. The website’s loading times are bogged down by the
            size of my code, so better, cleaner code can be implemented. Using frameworks would be helpful as well. Much
            of
            the website can be broken down into repeatable components, so optimizing in React is a plan for this
            website’s
            future.
